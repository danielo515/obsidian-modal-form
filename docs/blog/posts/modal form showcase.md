Hello everyone.

I've created this thread so people can share their awesome workflows using modal forms.

A lot of times people that open feature requests mention they need such feature to complete their workflow, or that such feature will make their workflow simpler, and then they mention what their workflow is about and then blow my mind.

I saw other plugins also have similar threads, so I decided to create this one to encourage people to share their forms and how are they using them.

Anyone is free to provide their experiences however they want, but here are some suggestions that I think will make each post even more useful for everyone:

- Start the thread with a summary of the workflow or the problem you are solving.
- If you can, export your form as a JSON file and share it in the thread using a code block. This will make it easier for others to use your form.
- If you can, share a screenshot of your form. This will make it easier for others to understand what your form looks like and makes it a lot more engaging.
- If you are calling the form from a template, please share the template as well in another code block.
- If you are okay about including your post as part of the example vault on modal form repository, please say so, then others just looking at the plugin repository can see your example.

And that's all.
I'm very excited about seeing all the different workflows and how you use modal forms, and I hope this will be a great way to share and learn from each other.
